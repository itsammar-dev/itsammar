### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Ammar

I'm Ammar, a Software Engineer & Researcher, and student based in Atlanta. 

I'm currently pursuing a double major in Applied Mathematics and Chemistry while building software and research projects at the intersection of health and AI. I work on large-scale data analysis and real-time systems.

Previously, I've built: 
- Designed research data pipelines for physiological data
- Developed full-stack applications with Next.js, Prisma, Supabase, and AWS
- Explored blockchain analytics, experimenting with algorithms for token and market analysis

Outside of being a student and researcher, I love trying new coffee orders, writing, reading, and diving into random topics just for the joy of learning. Iâ€™m also passionate about expanding the reach of healthcare and education to underserved populations, and Iâ€™m constantly sketching out new project ideas around that mission.
